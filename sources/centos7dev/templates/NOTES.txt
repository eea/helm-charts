Enjoy you Alma Linux development image ({{ .Chart.AppVersion }})

{{- if .Values.networkSecurity.enabled -}}
This pod has network security enabled. This means you can not
connect to anything outside the namespace - including the Internet.

This is to prevent lateral migration. If you need Internet access,
then redeploy with:

    networkSecurity:
      enabled: false

But don't keep it as default - just like you would use `sudo` temporarily
for root access on a Linux VM.
{{- end }}
